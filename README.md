`bstree` is a Go package providing a binary search tree. 

[Package documentation from GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/mattnworb/bstree)

This is toy code I wrote while trying to learn more about Go, and the red-black
tree implementation borrows heavily from the one found in `java.util.TreeMap`.
